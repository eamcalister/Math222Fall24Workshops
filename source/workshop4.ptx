<worksheet><title>Being Careful with Series</title>

<p>
	In this workshop we will:
</p>
<objectives>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				analyze proposed answers to series convergence questions which may have forgotten to check a hypothsis of a convergence test and 
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				carefully (showing <em>all</em> work) answer several convergence questions for assessment purposes. 
			</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</objectives>

<exercise>
	<p>
		A student submitted the forllowing argument regarding the convergence of <m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{-1}{n}</m>:
	</p>
	<assemblage>
		<title>Student Solution</title>
		<p>
			Since <m>\frac{-1}{n} &lt; \frac{1}{n^2}</m> for all <m>n&gt;1</m> and <m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}</m> is a convergent <m>p</m>-series, we can conclude that <m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{-1}{n}</m> converges by the Comparison Test.
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				(4 points) Is the conclusion of this argument correct? Justify your answer.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				(4 points) Exactly what error was made by the student in attempting to apply the Comparison Test? What did they forget to check?

		<title>Student Solution</title>
		<p>
			Observe that if <m>f(x) = \sin^2(\pi x) + \frac{1}{x^2}</m>, then we have <m>f(n) = \frac{1}{n^2}</m>. Observe that <m>f(x)</m> is a positive continuous function and the improper integral <me>\int_{1}^{\infty} \sin^{2}(\pi x) + \frac{1}{x^2} \,dx</me> diverges. Hence we can conclude that <m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}</m> diverges by the Integral Test.

		The main take away from the last two questions should be that you need to carefully check all the hypotheses of a convergence test in order to be sure its conclusion is correct. For each of the following series, carefully decide whether it converges or diverges, and if it converges, is the convergence absolute or conditional. By <q>carfully</q>, I mean you should do the following:
	</p>

	<p><ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				State which test you will use and say why.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Show all the hypotheses of the test are satisfied.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Perform any calculations necessary and give your conclusion.
			</p>
		</li>

	</ul></p>

	<p><ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				<m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}2^n}{n!}</m>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{\sqrt{n}}</m>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{n}{3n+1}\right)^n</m>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				<m>\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \sin^{3}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)</m> Hint: For <m>x</m> near zero, <m>\sin(x)\approx x</m>.
