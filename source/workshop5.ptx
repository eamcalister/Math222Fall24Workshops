<worksheet><title>Taylor Polynomials and Numerical Integration</title>

	<p>
		The goal of this workshop is to connect the error bound for Taylor polynomial approximations to an error bound for a numerical integration method. Specifically, we will work through proving the error bound <me>\left|\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx - \mbox{MID}(n)\right|\leq \frac{M(b-a)^3}{24n^2}</me> when <m>|f''(x)|\leq M</m> for <m>a\leq x\leq b</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The main student learning goals for this assignment are the following:
	</p>

	<objectives><ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				You should become more comfortable with abstract mathematical notation and concepts.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				You will better understand the connection between the midpoint rule and linear approximation.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				You will become more accustomed to translating between verbal/visual descriptions of mathematics and symbolic manipulation. This is a critical communication skill in STEM disciplines.
			</p>
		</li>

	</ul></objectives>

	<p>
		Before we begin the questions, we first need to set up the notation for all of the questions. We will have a function <m>f(x)</m> that is defined and twice differentiable for <m>a\leq x\leq b</m>. We suppose that <m>|f''(x)|\leq M</m> for all <m>a\leq x\leq b</m>. The interval <m>[a,b]</m> is subdivided into <m>n</m> intervals of equal length <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}</m>. The endpoints of each sub-interval are labeled as follows: <me>\begin{aligned}
x_0 &amp; = &amp;a\\
x_1 &amp; = &amp;a+\Delta x\\
\ &amp; \vdots &amp; \\
x_i &amp; = &amp; a + i\Delta x\\
\ &amp; \vdots &amp; \\
x_n &amp; = &amp; b.\\
\end{aligned}</me> The midpoints of each sub-interval are given by <m>m_i = \frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}</m>.
	</p>

<exercise>>
	<p>
		(4 points) In terms of <m>\Delta x</m> what are the quantities <m>(x_{i+1}-x_i)</m>, <m>(x_{i+1}-m_i)</m>, and <m>(x_{i} - m_i)</m>. Show your answers algebraically and explain with a picture.
	</p>
</exercise>

<exercise>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				(4 points) Show that
				<me>
					\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(m_i) + f'(m_i)(x-m_i)\, dx = f(m_i)\Delta x.
				</me>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				(4 points) What does <m>f(m_i) + f'(m_i)(x-m_i)</m> represent? Use a picture to explain why the result of part (a) makes sense geometrically. (You may want to go back and look at your notes on the midpoint rule.)
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				(4 points) Explain why 
<me>
\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(x)\,dx
</me>
and use the result of part (a) to explain why
<me>
\mbox{MID}(n)  = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(m_i) + f'(m_i)(x-m_i)\,dx.
</me>

		</li>
	</ol>

<exercise>
	<p>
		Now we'll put it all together.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				(6 points)
					Use the error bound for Taylor polynomials to show that
<me>
\left|\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(x) - (f(m_i) + f'(m_i)(x-m_i))\,dx\right|\leq \frac{M(x_{i+1} - m_i)^{3}}{6} - \frac{M(x_{i} - m_i)^{3}}{6}.
</me>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				(4 points) Use some of your answers to question (1) to show the right-hand side of the inequality in part (a) simplifies to
<me>
\frac{M(b-a)^3}{24n^3}.
</me>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				(4 points) Use (2c) and part (b) of this question to show the error bound for <m>\mbox{MID}(n)</m> given at the top of this workshop.
