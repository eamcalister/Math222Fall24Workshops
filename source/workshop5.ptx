<worksheet><title>Taylor Polynomials and Numerical Integration</title>
	<p>
	<term>This workshop is due Friday, April 7.</term> Work in teams, and turn in one carefully written copy per team. It is strongly encouraged that each student write up their own copy even if it is not the copy that gets turned in.
	</p>

	<p>
		The goal of this workshop is to connect the error bound for Taylor polynomial approximations to an error bound for a numerical integration method. Specifically, we will work through proving the error bound <me>\left|\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx - \mbox{MID}(n)\right|\leq \frac{M(b-a)^3}{24n^2}</me> when <m>|f''(x)|\leq M</m> for <m>a\leq x\leq b</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The main student learning goals for this assignment are the following:
	</p>

	<p><ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				You should become more comfortable with abstract mathematical notation and concepts.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				You will better understand the connection between the midpoint rule and linear approximation.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				You will become more accustomed to translating between verbal/visual descriptions of mathematics and symbolic manipulation. This is a critical communication skill in STEM disciplines.
			</p>
		</li>

	</ul></p>

	<p>
		Before we begin the questions, we first need to set up the notation for all of the questions. We will have a function <m>f(x)</m> that is defined and twice differentiable for <m>a\leq x\leq b</m>. We suppose that <m>|f''(x)|\leq M</m> for all <m>a\leq x\leq b</m>. The interval <m>[a,b]</m> is subdivided into <m>n</m> intervals of equal length <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}</m>. The endpoints of each sub-interval are labeled as follows: <me>\begin{aligned}
x_0 &amp; = &amp;a\\
x_1 &amp; = &amp;a+\Delta x\\
\ &amp; \vdots &amp; \\
x_i &amp; = &amp; a + i\Delta x\\
\ &amp; \vdots &amp; \\
x_n &amp; = &amp; b.\\
\end{aligned}</me> The midpoints of each sub-interval are given by <m>m_i = \frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In terms of <m>\Delta x</m> what are the quantities <m>(x_{i+1}-x_i)</m>, <m>(x_{i+1}-m_i)</m>, and <m>(x_{i} - m_i)</m>. Show your answers algebraically and explain with a picture.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now weâ€™ll put it together.
