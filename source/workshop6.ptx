		Dr. McAlister recently cooked his traditional Easter rack of lamb, but it was a disaster! He totally overcooked it. He knows, based on his knowledge of Newton’s Law of Cooling and some measurements to determine the thermal capacity his <m>2</m> lb. rack, that the internal temperature <m>H</m> (for heat), in <m>^{\circ}</m>F, in a <m>300^{\circ}</m>F oven satisfies the differential equation <me>H^{\prime} = -.62(H-300),</me> where <m>t</m> is the time, in hours, after the rack is placed in the oven. After a quick sear on the outside, the initial temperature of his rack of lamb is <m>H(0) = 60</m>. In order for the meat to be medium rare, it needs to have an internal temperature of <m>135^{\circ}</m>F. You will answer how long to cook the rack of lamb using a better version of Euler’s Method using second degree Taylor polynomials.

		Consider the initial value problem <me>y'' + 4y = 0\ \ ,y(0)= 0\ \ ,y'(0) = 3.</me> Use implicit differentiation to find all the derivatives of <m>y</m> at <m>t=0</m>, then use your answers to construct a Taylor series for the solution to this initial value problem. What is the more familiar formula for this solution?
