	<p>
		Suppose you want to purchase a house that costs <m>\$250,000</m>. The annual interest rate on your loan will be <m>3\%</m> (so <m>0.25\%</m> monthly), and the loan term will be 30 years and the monthly payment will be <m>M</m> dollars. We want to solve for <m>M</m>. Assume you make your first payment at the end of the first month you have possession of the house.
	</p>

	<p>
		The goal of this problem is to write a repeating decimal as a fraction using a geometric series. We begin by recognizing a given geometric series as a repeating decimal.
