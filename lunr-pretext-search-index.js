The formula for kinetic energy First, we will establish the following notation for this problem:   Velocity = = The rate of change in position.    Acceleration = = the rate of change in velocity.    Force equals mass acceleration     Work = Force distance when the force is constant.   The key to finding a formula for kinetic energy is to observe that the kinetic energy of an object of mass and velocity is the work done in accelerating that object to velocity from rest.

Kinetic energy of a spinning disk In order to find the kinetic energy of a spinning sphere (in the next problem), we first need to find the kinetic energy in a spinning disk.

To find its total kinetic energy, we slice it into rings of radius and width .   (4 points) Find the mass, in kg, and velocity, in m\/s, of each ring.

  "body": "Integrals with Computers  Even though we have learned integration techniques for many integrals in this class, it is often the case that antiderivatives cannot be written in terms of familiar functions (the so called elementary functions , which are essentially all the ones you learn about in Precalculus). When elementary antiderivatives don't exist (it's not just that you can't find them), one must turn to numerical approximation techniques to approximate definite integrals. We learned about these approximation techniques in class. They are very repetitive to do by hand, so we will program a computer to do them. In the process we will learn some Python using the Sympy and Numpy packages.   Symbolic Integration  To do integrals and derivatives symbolically (i.e. to get a formulas), we use the Sympy package. The following is straightforward to use.   import sympy as sp #define your variable as a symbol x = sp.symbols('x') #define your function f = x**2 print(sp.integrate(f,x)) print(sp.diff(f,x))     Numerical Methods  In this section we give a Python script for a right-hand Riemann sum. You can find a Jupyter notebook on Canvas that has this, as well as a left-hand Riemann sum and the midpoint rule. Since we know the trapezoid rule and Simpson's rule are computed from these, that's all we'll code up right now.  The right-hand Riemann sum is below, with some further explanation for those who know some Python.   import numpy as np #right-hand Riemann sum def right_hand_rule(f,a,b,n): #a and b are the endpoints and n is the number of rectangles x = np.linspace(a,b,n+1) #this creates the set of n+1 evenly spaced points starting at a and ending at b. y = f(x) h = (b-a)\/n integral = h*np.sum(y[1:n+1]) return integral #### Don't Modify above this line. #define function to integrate def f(x): return x**2 #change this function as needed #Give the endpoints and number of sub-intervals a = 0 b = 2 n = 3 print(right_hand_rule(f,a,b,n))     Exercises  For these exercises, we will be considering the definite integral     (2 points) Describe where you get stuck doing this integral by hand.    (2 points) What does Matlab give you for an antiderivative of (enter exp(x) for )? Is it useful (to you)?

Hence we can conclude that diverges by the Integral Test.  The main take away from the last two questions should be that you need to carefully check all the hypotheses of a convergence test in order to be sure its conclusion is correct. For each of the following series, carefully decide whether it converges or diverges, and if it converges, is the convergence absolute or conditional. By carfully , I mean you should do the following:    State which test you will use and say why.    Show all the hypotheses of the test are satisfied.

It is strongly encouraged that each student write up their own copy even if it is not the copy that gets turned in.  The goal of this workshop is to connect the error bound for Taylor polynomial approximations to an error bound for a numerical integration method. Specifically, we will work through proving the error bound when for .  The main student learning goals for this assignment are the following:    You should become more comfortable with abstract mathematical notation and concepts.    You will better understand the connection between the midpoint rule and linear approximation.    You will become more accustomed to translating between verbal\/visual descriptions of mathematics and symbolic manipulation. This is a critical communication skill in STEM disciplines.    Before we begin the questions, we first need to set up the notation for all of the questions. We will have a function that is defined and twice differentiable for . We suppose that for all . The interval is subdivided into intervals of equal length . The endpoints of each sub-interval are labeled as follows: The midpoints of each sub-interval are given by .   In terms of what are the quantities , , and . Show your answers algebraically and explain with a picture.  Now we’ll put it together.  "
