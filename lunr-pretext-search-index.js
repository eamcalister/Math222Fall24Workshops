  "body": "Instructions for Students  First we will address what a Calculus \"workshop\" is and why your professor has you doing them.   A workshop is a set of problems that are usually on the more difficult end of the difficulty spectrum.    The problems in a workshop will usually bring together material from several days (or textbook sections) of class and ask you to apply it in interesting ways.    Because workshops are done in groups and written up carefully (see instructions below), workshops will help develop your technical, in particular mathematical, communication skills.    Workshops also allow us to pause and figure out if we really understand the things we have been learning. By letting you work on them in class (over a day or somethimes two) and giving detailed feedback, your professor uses them as formative assessment (which also helps you).      Workshop Instructions:    You will work in groups of two or (at most) three. Groups will be recorded for these assignments on Canvas and one assignment will be turned in per group. All group members will receive the same grade. The intention is that all members of the group will complete and understand the solution to every problem. Do not use a \"divide and conquer\" strategy.     Your write-up should be either typed or neatly handwritten. Be sure that you answer every part of every question and show all your work. Incomplete answers or illegible work will result in a reduced grade.    To reiterate that one of the objectives of a workshop is to practice mathematical communication, treat your classmates as the target audience of your writting. Your professor is really good at filling in gaps in your work, but most people might not be able to do that. This is why you need to show work.    Due dates for workshops will be stated in class on the day they are assigned and indicated on Canvas.     "

In this workshop we will:     derive the formula for the kinetic energy of an object of mass traveling with velocity ,    apply this formula and integration to find the kinetic energy of a spinning object, and    answer a \"fun\" baseball question.     The formula for kinetic energy First, we will establish the following notation for this problem:   Velocity = = The rate of change in position.    Acceleration = = the rate of change in velocity.    Force equals mass acceleration     Work = Force distance when the force is constant.   The key to finding a formula for kinetic energy is to observe that the kinetic energy of an object of mass and velocity is the work done in accelerating that object to velocity from rest. Assuming that velocity is achieved when , the work integral to calculate kinetic energy is where the velocity is reached after seconds.

Hint: Use a standard integration technique.    Kinetic energy of a spinning disk In order to find the kinetic energy of a spinning sphere (in the next problem), we first need to find the kinetic energy in a spinning disk.

  "title": "Integrals with Computers",
  "body": "Integrals with Computers  In this workshop we will:     learn to input symbolic functions into Python in order to differentiate and integrate them symbolically,    use Python to apply our known numerical integration algorithms (with whatever number of subdivisions we choose) when necessary, and    use error bounds for each numerical method to determine a definite integral within a given accuracy when an elementary antiderivative does not exist.     Even though we have learned integration techniques for many integrals in this class, it is often the case that antiderivatives cannot be written in terms of familiar functions (the so called elementary functions , which are essentially all the ones you learn about in Precalculus). When elementary antiderivatives don't exist (it's not just that you can't find them), one must turn to numerical approximation techniques to approximate definite integrals. We learned about these approximation techniques in class. They are very repetitive to do by hand, so we will program a computer to do them. In the process we will learn some Python using the Sympy and Numpy packages.   Symbolic Integration  To do integrals and derivatives symbolically (i.e. to get a formulas), we use the Sympy package (Sympy is for symbolic calculations with Python). The following is straightforward to use.   import sympy as sp #define your variable as a symbol x = sp.symbols('x') #define your function f = x**2 print(sp.integrate(f,x)) print(sp.diff(f,x))     Numerical Methods  In this section we give a Python script for a right-hand Riemann sum using the Numpy package (Numpy is for numerical calculation vs. symbolic). You can find a Python script on Canvas that has this, as well as a left-hand Riemann sum and the midpoint rule. Since we know the trapezoid rule and Simpson's rule are computed from these, that's all we'll code up right now.  The right-hand Riemann sum is below, with some further explanation for those who know some Python.   import numpy as np #right-hand Riemann sum def right_hand_rule(f,a,b,n): #a and b are the endpoints and n is the number of rectangles x = np.linspace(a,b,n+1) #this creates the set of n+1 evenly spaced points starting at a and ending at b. y = f(x) h = (b-a)\/n integral = h*np.sum(y[1:n+1]) return integral #### Don't Modify above this line. #define function to integrate def f(x): return x**2 #change this function as needed #Give the endpoints and number of sub-intervals a = 0 b = 2 n = 3 print(right_hand_rule(f,a,b,n))   In order for numerical integration rules (RIGHT, LEFT, MID, TRAP, and SIMP) to really be useful in real-world situations, we need to answer the following related questions:   For a given function, on a given interval, using one of the rules, how much does the error decrease as we increase and how large will need to be to make the error as small as we want?    How much better are the ``better'' rules than ones that are easier to compute?     To begin answering these, fill in the following blanks using your understanding of RIGHT, LEFT, MID, and TRAP. Be sure you can explain each answer using a picture.   Relation of Methods to Derivatives     If on , then     If on , then     If on , then     If on , then       So we see that error in LEFT and RIGHT depends somehow on the first derivative, while the error in MID and TRAP depends somehow on the second. The following list of numerical error bounds can be derived using material from section 10.4 of the text and\/or integration by parts. However, it would be fairly time consuming to derive them, so we will instead focus on their use.   Error Bounds for Numerical Integration Methods    Left and Right Error Bounds  If for all , then and    Trap and Mid Error Bounds  If for all , then and    Simpson's Rule Bound  If for all , then       Using the Error Bound Formulas  Suppose we want to numerically integrate from to . We know the exact answer is . However, maybe we don't know the exact value of (we know it's less than , but not much else), that may not be useful. Let's use rectangles and estimate the error for each method. To do this we must:   Find the upper bound on the appropriate derivative for . Since the derivative of is , we can say when . That is, for all the methods.    Now plug into each formula to estimate possible errors with .     We get the following:       This means the error using Simpson's Rule with just two rectangles will be less than or equal to . If we apply Simpson's rule to this integral with , we get The value of given by a calculator is . The actual error turns out to be about , which is less than the bound. If we wanted to know how big needs to be to get to be within of the exact value, we would solve and get . This rounds up to . So, if , will give as good an estimate as .    Exercises  For these exercises, we will be considering the definite integral     (2 points) Describe where you get stuck doing this integral by hand.
